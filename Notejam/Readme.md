## Pending Work
The design and conceptual part is done. However the end to end code is not done which is also not expected as part of this. Project structure is also well defined now and developer should just add more classes inside to it. 
Database collection is there and just need to add more schema under to it. Below are some open points to be developed.
- Implementation of Authentication and Authorization
- Register App in AAD
- Implementation of SSO
- Write the Unit Tests for all classes
- Complete UI work
- Add Users schema in DB
- Implementation of User Sign-Up part 
- CI-CD Pipeline
